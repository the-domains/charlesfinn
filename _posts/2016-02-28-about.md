Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I'm a data scientist at SCL Group and a PhD graduate in astrophysics from Durham University UK. This website is a home for my professional resume, blog posts, thoughts on various topics, and a place to share my interests and passions. I hope you enjoy having a look around.
